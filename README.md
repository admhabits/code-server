# Code Server Install Script
___

### Run Script:
```bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Val7498/Install-code-server/master/script.sh)```

### Notes:


This will create a symlink to your `/bin/` directory, if you are okay with that so that you may run the IDE using `code-server`.
The default directory set in this script is ~/Projects so it does not show all the other stuff you have on your home directory

### What is Coder?

Some cool software that allows you to use VS Code on the go, I ended up installing it on some machines and then automated it with this exact script.
